# Singapore Airlines Digital HR Assistant

Singapore Airlines Digital HR Assistant, Jesslyn, is an application built for making the recruitment process of Singapore Airlines cabin crew more efficient. Interested candidates can create an account and be interviewed any time, anywhere at their convenience. Jesslyn provides an efficient, user friendly and high tech interview experience, and maintains the video recording of the entire process. It then uses machine learning to analyze these interviews and shortlist the best candidates in terms of their english speaking profiency, tone, sincerity and other metrics. The top candidates move on to the next stage whereby they will be interviewed by SIA's HR executives and management. This saves the company a great deal of human resources and time since only the best and most qualified interviewees have to be interviewed by the management.
