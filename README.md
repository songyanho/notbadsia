### Business Case: Cabin Crew Digital Recruitment

As the icon of our industry-leading brand of service, the recruitment of cabin crew is carried out meticulously through many rounds of selection. With over a thousand candidates in each exercise, this can be resource intensive and time consuming. How can we improve this recruitment process and at the same time inspire more millennial to be part of the cabin crew?

## Project: Ms Jesslyn, Digital HR Assistant

Singapore Airlines Digital HR Assistant, Jesslyn, is an application built for making the recruitment process of Singapore Airlines cabin crew more efficient. Interested candidates can create an account and be interviewed any time, anywhere at their convenience. Jesslyn provides an efficient, user friendly and high tech interview experience, and maintains the video recording of the entire process. It then uses machine learning to analyze these interviews and shortlist the best candidates in terms of their english speaking profiency, tone, sincerity and other metrics. The top candidates move on to the next stage whereby they will be interviewed by SIA's HR executives and management. This saves the company a great deal of human resources and time since only the best and most qualified interviewees have to be interviewed by the management.
